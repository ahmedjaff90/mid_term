Overview:
This project involves the creation of a PHP OOP REST API designed to manage quotations, including famous quotes and user submissions. The backend infrastructure is supported by a PostgreSQL database, quotesdb, which contains three tables with specific column definitions.

Features:
API Development: Built a PHP OOP REST API that supports various HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The API provides responses in JSON format, including details for quotes (ID, text, author, category) and authors (ID, name).

Database Design: Established a PostgreSQL database (quotesdb) with three tables to store quotes, authors, and categories. Utilized Postbird for database management and populated the database with at least 5 categories, 5 authors, and 25 quotes.

Deployment: Deployed the project on Repl.it, with the database hosted on Render.com. Detailed documentation was provided on Blackboard, including deployment instructions and how to manage the GitHub repository.

Documentation: Created a comprehensive GitHub repository with a README.md file, including the project name, link to the Repl.it homepage, and a PDF document outlining challenges and solutions encountered during development.

Usage:
The API is accessible through the deployed URL on Repl.it. It supports the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of quotations, with structured responses and robust data management.
